# Alexa Discord Bot
A personal assistant for discord.

People use Discord for all sorts of things, and sometimes itâ€™s more convenient for them to have a personal assistant on
Discord to view weather, news, etc.
The solution to the problem is to create a Discord bot which acts as a personal assistant.

To do this, we used the following:
 * discord.py (and PyNaCl)
 * requests
 * wikipedia
 * PyDictionary
 * Bs4

To run a command, type `Alexa, `, followed by the command and any other arguments.
The following is a list of commands:
 + help
 + info
 + simon says
 + add
 + subtract
 + multiply
 + divide
 + weather in
 + make me
 + reset my color
 + time
 + date
 + super alexa
 + translate
 + roll dice
 + flip coin
 + ping
 + lookup
 + rickroll
 + play blackjack
 + play unfair rps
 + play rps
 + rick astley
 + top headlines
 
 They are used to attain the following features:
 - Play games
 - Rickroll people
 - Translate words
 - Get the date and time
 - Roll dice
 - Change your color
 - Get the weather in any city
 - Wikipedia lookup
 - Get news headlines
 - Easter eggs
